This error occurs when using the Expo CLI to build an Android APK. The error message is cryptic and doesn't provide much information. The build process fails silently without any clear indication of what went wrong. This bug is particularly difficult to debug because it doesn't provide specific error messages.  It might manifest in different ways and seems to be tied to the interaction between Expo's build process and the Android build system.
